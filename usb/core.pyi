    Additionally, the class provides methods to communicate with the hardware.
    Typically, an application will first call the set_configuration() method to
    put the device in a known configured state, optionally call the
    set_interface_altsetting() to select the alternate setting (if there is
    more than one) of the interface used, and call the write() and read()
    methods to send and receive data, respectively.

    When working in a new hardware, the first try could be like this:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=myVendorId, idProduct=myProductId)
    >>> dev.set_configuration()
    >>> dev.write(1, test)

    This sample finds the device of interest (myVendorId and myProductId should
    be replaced by the corresponding values of your device), then configures
    the device (by default, the configuration value is 1, which is a typical
    value for most devices) and then writes some data to the endpoint 0x01.

    Timeout values for the write, read and ctrl_transfer methods are specified
    in milliseconds. If the parameter is omitted, Device.default_timeout value
    will be used instead. This property can be set by the user at anytime.

    r"""Find an USB device and return it.

    find() is the function used to discover USB devices.  You can pass as
    arguments any combination of the USB Device Descriptor fields to match a
    device. For example:

    find(idVendor=0x3f4, idProduct=0x2009)

    will return the Device object for the device with idVendor field equals
    to 0x3f4 and idProduct equals to 0x2009.

    If there is more than one device which matchs the criteria, the first one
    found will be returned. If a matching device cannot be found the function
    returns None. If you want to get all devices, you can set the parameter
    find_all to True, then find will return an iterator with all matched devices.
    If no matching device is found, it will return an empty iterator. Example:

    for printer in find(find_all=True, bDeviceClass=7):
        print (printer)

    This call will get all the USB printers connected to the system.  (actually
    may be not, because some devices put their class information in the
    Interface Descriptor).

    You can also use a customized match criteria:

    dev = find(custom_match = lambda d: d.idProduct=0x3f4 and d.idvendor=0x2009)

    A more accurate printer finder using a customized match would be like
    so:

    def is_printer(dev):
        import usb.util
        if dev.bDeviceClass == 7:
            return True
        for cfg in dev:
            if usb.util.find_descriptor(cfg, bInterfaceClass=7) is not None:
                return True

    for printer in find(find_all=True, custom_match = is_printer):
        print (printer)

    Now even if the device class code is in the interface descriptor the
    printer will be found.

    You can combine a customized match with device descriptor fields. In this
    case, the fields must match and the custom_match must return True. In the
    our previous example, if we would like to get all printers belonging to the
    manufacturer 0x3f4, the code would be like so:

    printers = list(find(find_all=True, idVendor=0x3f4, custom_match=is_printer))

    If you want to use find as a list all devices function, just call
    it with find_all = True:

    devices = list(find(find_all=True))

    Finally, you can pass a custom backend to the find function:

    find(backend = MyBackend())

    PyUSB has builtin backends for libusb 0.1, libusb 1.0 and OpenUSB.  If you
    do not supply a backend explicitly, find() function will select one of the
    predefineds backends according to system availability.

    Backends are explained in the usb.backend module.
